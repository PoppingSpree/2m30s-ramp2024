"I don't get it. Do you have a fear of water?"
"No? I'm more afraid of you than I am of the water. ...And I can't swim. That and I don't have the fortune of a swimsuit on me."
"You don't need a swimsuit. Just lose the suit and I'll teach you to swim, sweetie."
[Splash] "I'm flattered, but I'll stay up here."
[Splash] "Your loss. Say, do you hear something?"
"I've been exposed to a bit too much gunfire to hear well. What do you hear?"
"I'm not sure. I think it's breathing? Or someone talking to themself?"

(If player has approached but not actually entered the pool sector.)
"Hey! Over here! Are you here for the pool party?"
"Oh. Hello. Been a long time since we've seen fresh faces."

"So... Gunfire? You've never told me, what's it like where you're from?"
"Well. The Grand United Nation of States is much bigger than this. Louder too. Our, uh, 'demons' look a lot more like you and me. Though there were guns everywhere. Amusing that's the same. In all honesty, you look like you'ld fit right in with home."
"I know how to work a gun, but I've never needed to use one. It's always been quiet and relaxed up in the hills. At most you might see those red ball guys. They're kinda cute from a distance."
"Cacodemons? I stay away from them. They're sturdy and pack a whallop if you tick 'em off. They're rare in easier hells, fortunately. I didn't go in the harder portals. Wasn't keen on getting torn apart."
"Did you travel the portals a lot? I never left far from home. Just the festive looking places to see who was passing through."

"We could do anything right now, and nobody would know..."
"Ah. Hahaha. Maybe we just stick to swimming lessons for now. Or you could try asking them... Though they look a bit preoccupied to me."
(Addressing "What is the nature of a RAMP" whether they know it or not)
"If you had the power to make a world of your own and put anything you like in it, what would you make?"
"Nothing good, probably. Why this all of a sudden?"
"I'm a terrible artist. I can barely draw a map and my penmanship is unreadable!"
"Often, a 'terrible artist' is just one who hasn't been given the encouragement and time to explore and find their niche. If I ask you 'if you could make anything, what would you make?' what is the first thing to come to mind? Don't think too hard about it."
"I suppose I'd make a giant cup of tea  to swim in! Or a big jello carrot planet that's super squishy and wiggly and juicy. But... That sounds kinda silly-"
"And I'd make a toyhouse full of soft plushie bunny kids and a ton of glitter. At least, that's how I got my start. It was never my plan or desire to delve into transmortalism, but when my partner needed me most, I couldn't think of anything other than replacing parts of her like the dolls she adored. I was terrified. I've made bad calls before. Been called a creep more times than I can remember. And in the end, I was the one who got misplaced and left behind."
"I'm sorry. I didn't know..."
"And you didn't need to know. Sorry."
"I..."
"But, perhaps, if you somehow get another chance? Just try making things for yourself. Experiment. Have fun. And besides, is swimming not an art? You seem plenty good at that."
"I'll... think about it. Thank you."

(Player has NOT retreived all of Perci's items)
"Whoa. It's kinda pretty out there. And kinda scary. ...Do you think that it'll hurt?"
"Doubt it. No body: no senses. No senses: no pain. Or joy for that matter."
"Why do we hurt? Wouldn't it be easier if never felt pain?"
"Hurt is a system for bodies to know they need to change if they wish to survive. It's a fragile system, but an important one."

(Player HAS retreived all of Perci's items)
"Whoa. It looks like a painting out there now. I want to go out there. I want to touch it for myself. Or just see it a little longer.
"Then you should. Follow them. Maybe they can get out the same way they got in. Not much time left."
"What about you? Aren't you coming?"
"..."

(Player has NOT sufficiently annoyed Jean with their weapon)
"Does it really matter? I've made my bed and now I've got to lay in it."
"Does it have to matter? Let's just try something and see how it goes."
"I followed my heart and hurt a lot of people for the trouble. I have nothing left to share. Go."
"...Bye..."

(Player HAS sufficiently annoyed Jean with their weapon)
"I don't want to."
"What!? Come ON, we can at least see what happens if we try!"
"Let me finish. I don't want to go. I want terrible things. That won't change. But right now I feel like I have to do something."
"Then just do pretend terrible things and figure out the rest later."
"That doesn't make sense?"
"Catch up if you want me to make it make sense."
"Why are you like this!?"
