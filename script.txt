"I don't get it. Do you have a fear of water?"
"No? I'm more afraid of you than I am of the water. ...And I can't swim. That and I don't have the fortune of a swimsuit on me."
"You don't need a swimsuit. Just lose the suit and I'll teach you to swim, sweetie."
[Splash] "I'm flattered, but I'll stay up here."
[Splash] "Your loss. Say, do you hear something?"
"I've been exposed to a bit too much gunfire to hear well. What do you hear?"
"I'm not sure. I think it's breathing? Or someone talking to themself?"

(If player has approached but not actually entered the pool sector.)
"Hey! Over here! Are you here for the pool party?"
"Oh. Hello. Been a long time since we've seen fresh faces."

"So... Gunfire? You've never told me, what's it like where you're from?"
"Well. The Grand United Nation of States is much bigger than this. Louder too. Our, uh, 'demons' look a lot more like you and me. Though there were guns everywhere. Amusing that's the same. In all honesty, you look like you'ld fit right in with home."
"I know how to work a gun, but I've never needed to use one. It's always been quiet and relaxed up in the hills. At most you might see those red ball guys. They're kinda cute from a distance."
"Cacodemons? I stay away from them. They're sturdy and pack a whallop if you tick 'em off. They're rare in easier hells, fortunately. I didn't go in the harder portals. Wasn't keen on getting torn apart."
"Did you travel the portals a lot? I never left far from home. Just the festive looking places to see who was passing through."
