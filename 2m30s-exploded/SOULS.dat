AL_LAPINE_COMERS.SOUL
--------------------------------------------------
Formerly a very docile and creative rabbit who spent her life happily with her partner Rachelmaria until the Beast Balloon Infestation and Lunawakenings of the Bubble Menace. After Rachelmaria goes missing, Al takes up the family's "Kinsblade" heirloom revolver and the Toroko Tea from a crisis kit her family left to her. Changed by the red flower tea, she becomes nearly indestructible and capable of incredible combat feats, but is prone to confusion, rage, and impatience. A creative ranged fighter, she accepts missions from a PMC she has joined for the sole purpose of reuniting with Rachelmaria.

PERCIVAL_DREAMSIGHT_LAPINROSE.SOUL
--------------------------------------------------
An affectionate and bouncy rabbit with a fondness for swimming. From the pocket hell of Green Rolling Hills, Percy was formerly unaware of most worlds beyond the hub of RAMP 2023 and the tiny grassy homeland where her and her three friends resided. After the event ended, she knew she meant to meet someone for a pool party, but could not recall who, when, or why. And in waiting, she found she could not remember many things she thought she knew. Now she travels the various realms of RAMP to explore, experiment, and discover what it is she would like to make.

Sautillant Buster.

KILO_JEAN_SABRECATTE.SOUL
--------------------------------------------------
An individual of sincere passion with an affinity for cartoons, and toymaking. Born intersex, identifies as male. Guilty for his many misdeeds in his life with his manipulative former partner, he found himself in the worlds of RAMP purely by accident. Unable to return to the Grand United Nation of States, he treats the ecclectic mix of festive celebration and horrific hells as a suitable punishment for a "candy colored villain". A prolific creator in the past, fear of meeting a violent end made him unwilling to leave his cozy poolside position.
